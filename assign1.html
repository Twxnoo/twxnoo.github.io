<h1>Response to Kate Wagner</h1>

<p>Upon first glimpse at the site, the immediate feeling was nostalgia. The 404-page not found, the huge, glitchy, graphic picture, the whole theme brought me back to being a kid just searching through random websites. As I read the blog, I couldn't help but daydream and reflect on my own first encounters with the internet. Sharing almost the same story but in a slightly different time frame. “The first time i remember logging in to the net was around 1998, when I was five years old. My father was with me; I remember him working his magic, getting the modem to hum its infamous atonal tune.” For me, I was 6 nagging and begging my mother to allow me to create a myspace account around 2008-09. Seeing the way my siblings interacted with the internet left me no choice but to eagerly search the “World Wide Web” and immerse myself into it.</p>
 <p>As the blog goes on and the narrative is identified I find myself in alliance with the thought that “...The new internet capitalizes on nostalgia as it eats away the old internet.” Throughout today’s internet and social media; trends from the early 2000’s media are coming back into play but improvised and new. For example, sites like Myspace are trying to come back but are nothing like the original, Film cameras are coming back in style, but out with the old times by adding mixed media and new techniques. Its media consolidation at its finest. “Nostalgia, I’m reminded, is profitable—it remains one of the easiest to execute and cheapest gifts of neoliberal culture.” In response to the blog, through the use of media convergence we see in today’s time how vintage assets are brought into the future and those old memories become something new with possibly different meanings.</p> 
	<p>“...The once-minimal, professional-class Facebook is now falling prey to the clutter and kitsch that careened Myspace into the black hole of uncoolness.” My analysis of Kate's statement is that as these once, so holy platforms that held themselves to a standard fell victim to the utter nonsense of the communities free speech, and fancier/more interactive apps; they die out from the youth and emerging adulthood that control the narrative of the future. To put that in reference, as the people (with nostalgia that miss these old sites/applications) see the media consolidation in today’s time it gives a weird feeling that the past is actually no longer but is indeed an indicator to let it go if not rebrand yourself. As I agree, the media is dying out, the old ways of the internet should be brought back as the new internet is controlled, restricted, and ad driven. We as consumers should have more creative control rather that’s through data or simply wanting to change the background of your profile.</p> 

<p>As the “FAANGS” continue to operate and presumably dominate the internet/media space, we as consumers should take note of all that is changing for the worse and stand up in any way against the limitations set upon the users. As stated, “The internet is perhaps the most potent and active delivery system in history.” With this consideration in mind, the FAANGS continue in their dominance over the internet, the risk is that news, messages, and valuable information could become susceptible to being blurred, lost, and misconceived. In a world where the digital realm plays a role in shaping perceptions and understanding,it’s necessary to safeguard the integrity of this influential medium.</p>
